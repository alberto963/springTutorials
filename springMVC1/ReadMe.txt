This project is created as spring project simple spring web maven.

It demostrates how to have:

1) a startup page index.jsp
2) a link with a MVC methodology handling for the request in index.jsp page (click me)
3) handling of a request in REST format (showMessageJson) with json result/

Urls:
http://localhost:8080/springMVC1/
http://localhost:8080/springMVC1/showMessage.html
http://localhost:8080/springMVC1/showMessageJson

Note:
Json result is accomplished because Jackson libs are in the classpath 
(and in deployment assembly).
