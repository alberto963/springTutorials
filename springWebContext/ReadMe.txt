This project is created as spring project simple spring web maven.

It demostrates how to have:

1) controller (spring)
2) a servlet (j2ee)
3) handling of a request in REST format (Servlet_0) with json result/
4) webApplicationContext

Urls:
http://localhost:8080/springWebContext/http://localhost:8080/springWebContext/Servlet_0

Note:
Json result is accomplished because Jackson libs are in the classpath 
(and in deployment assembly).
